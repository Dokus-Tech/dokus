# PEPPOL and Compliance

Dokus supports PEPPOL workflows as infrastructure.

Design constraints:
- keep compliance flows explicit and low-friction
- avoid exposing provider complexity in regular UI paths
- preserve traceability for business-critical operations

Compliance should be reliable and operationally boring.
