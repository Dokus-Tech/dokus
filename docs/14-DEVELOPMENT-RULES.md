# Development Rules

Before implementing a feature:

1. identify the user pain clearly
2. verify scope alignment
3. choose the simplest safe implementation

Rules:
- no scope creep
- no silent irreversible behavior
- no UX complexity without clear payoff
- no feature that cannot be explained in plain terms
