# AI Scope and Limits

AI in Dokus is assistive.

AI may:
- extract structured data
- suggest classifications and links
- flag inconsistencies
- support contextual Q&A

AI may not:
- make legal/tax decisions on behalf of users
- hide uncertainty
- execute irreversible actions without explicit confirmation

All AI output must be reviewable and reversible.
