# UX and Design Principles

Design for stressed operators handling financial tasks.

Rules:
- plain language over jargon
- explicit statuses and outcomes
- minimal required input
- progressive disclosure for advanced detail

Operational split:
- mobile: capture and quick actions
- desktop: review, reconciliation, and editing
