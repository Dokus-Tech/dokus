# READ THIS FIRST

This documentation defines what Dokus is and what it is not.

It is written primarily for:

- AI coding agents
- Future contributors
- The founder when tired and tempted to add features

If any code, task, or proposal contradicts these documents:
→ The proposal is wrong.

Dokus succeeds by being narrow, calm, and useful.
