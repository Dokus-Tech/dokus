## 🎯 The Core Strategy (2-Minute Version)

### The Opportunity
- **Belgium mandates Peppol e-invoicing January 1, 2026**
- 40,000 IT freelancers need compliance solution
- Penalties: €1,500-5,000 for non-compliance
- **Your window: 15 months to capture market**
- Most competitors haven't positioned for developers specifically

### The Product
- **Dokus = "Accounting with a REST API"**
- Peppol-ready invoicing + expense tracking + instant payments
- €18/month (vs €22-25 competitors)
- Built by developers, for developers

### The Execution (Solo Founder Timeline)
- **Oct-Dec 2024:** Build MVP solo, beta with 15-20 users
- **Jan-Mar 2025:** Public launch, accountant partnerships, €1-1.5K MRR
- **Apr-Dec 2025:** Scale to €10-12K MRR (€120-144K ARR) **still solo**
- **2026:** Decide - hire team and scale, or keep it lifestyle business

### The Numbers That Matter
- **Your work capacity:** 60-80 hours/week (competitive advantage)
- **Target CAC:** €40-80 (via accountant partnerships)
- **Target Conversion:** 25-30% trial-to-paid
- **Target Churn:** <5% monthly
- **Target Year 1:** €120-144K ARR solo (most founders with teams don't hit this)

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Building Too Much Before Launch
❌ **Don't:** Spend 6 months building perfect product  
✅ **Do:** Ship MVP in 6-8 weeks, iterate with real users

### 2. Trying to Be Everything
❌ **Don't:** "Accounting software for all small businesses"  
✅ **Do:** "Financial management for IT freelancers in Belgium"

### 3. Ignoring the Deadline
❌ **Don't:** Treat 2026 as just another feature  
✅ **Do:** Make compliance deadline central to ALL marketing

### 4. Hiring Too Early
❌ **Don't:** Hire at €2-3K MRR "to help you scale"  
✅ **Do:** Prove you can hit €10K+ MRR solo first

### 5. Working "Balanced Hours"
❌ **Don't:** Work 40 hours/week and expect fast results  
✅ **Do:** You said you work hard - use that as competitive advantage

### 6. Ignoring Metrics
❌ **Don't:** "I feel like it's going well..."  
✅ **Do:** Track MRR, CAC, churn, conversion WEEKLY

### 7. Stopping When It Gets Hard
❌ **Don't:** Quit during the "trough of sorrow" (Month 3-6)  
✅ **Do:** Push through. Success comes after most people quit.

### When You Question Your Work Capacity

## 🎯 The One-Page Business Plan

**Problem:** Belgian IT freelancers waste 10+ hours/month on bookkeeping and fear €1,500-5,000 penalties from 2026 e-invoicing mandate

**Solution:** Automated Peppol-ready financial software with instant payment links, built specifically for developers

**Market:** 40,000 Belgian IT freelancers → 147,000 Dutch (2026+)

**Competition:** All generic (Accountable, Yuki, Exact). No one targets developers specifically.

**Your Edge:**
1. Developer positioning (API-first, CLI, webhooks)
2. Solo founder speed (ship 2x faster than teams)
3. Willing to grind (60-80 hour weeks)
4. 2026 deadline urgency (14-month window)

**Business Model:** Freemium SaaS (€0, €18/mo, €35/mo)

**Distribution:**
1. Accountant partnerships (40% of customers, €50 CAC)
2. Content/SEO (30%, €60 CAC)  
3. Product-led/referrals (30%, €0 CAC)

**Year 1 Goal (Solo):** €120-144K ARR, 670-800 customers, profitable

**Year 2 Options:**
- **Solo path:** €300K ARR, €200K+ profit, 30-40 hrs/week
- **Team path:** €500K ARR, hire 3-4 people, scale to exit

## 💬 Reality Check

**This will be hard:**
- 60-80 hour weeks for 3-6 months
- Lonely at times (solo founder)
- Slow at first (Month 1-3)
- Stressful before deadlines

**This will be worth it:**
- You own 100% of a real business
- €120K+ ARR Year 1 is life-changing
- Freedom to choose your path Year 2+
- Skills that make you unstoppable

**The choice:**
Most founders work 40 hours, hire too early, dilute equity, struggle to €50K ARR.

You: Work 70 hours, stay solo, keep 100%, hit €120K+ ARR Year 1.

Which path do you want?
