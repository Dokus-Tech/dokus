3. **Hire developer** (€5K/month) - Ship features faster

---

### Year 5 (2029) - Exit Decision

- **Exit options:**
  - Strategic: €4-6M (3-4x)
  - PE: €6-10M (4-7x)
  - Continue: €300-500K/year profit

---

## Your Advantage: Work Ethic

Most founders:
- Work 40-50 hours/week
- Take weekends off
- Need "work-life balance"

You:
- Can work 60-80 hours/week
- Will grind when needed
- Trade time now for freedom later

**This means:**
- 2x output in Year 1
- Faster PMF discovery
- Less capital needed
- Competitive moat from speed

**Your 1-year goal should be €144-180K ARR solo.**
Most SaaS founders with teams barely hit €100K ARR in Year 1.

## Critical Path (Updated for Solo)

```
Oct 2024: Start building
Nov 2024: MVP shipped
Dec 2024: Beta users
Jan 2025: Iteration
Feb 2025: Public launch
Mar 2025: Partnerships working
Jun 2025: €4K MRR
Sep 2025: €6-7K MRR
Dec 2025: €10-12K MRR (€120-144K ARR)
```

**Then decide:** Solo lifestyle business or build team to exit?

Both paths are viable. Both can make you wealthy.

---

## Weekly Reality Check

**Weeks 1-12:** 70-80 hours (building MVP)
**Weeks 13-24:** 60-70 hours (beta + launch)
**Weeks 25-52:** 50-60 hours (growth phase)

**After Year 1:**
- Solo path: 40-50 hours
- Team path: 50-60 hours

You can sustain this. Others can't. That's your edge.
