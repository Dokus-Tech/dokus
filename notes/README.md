# Dokus - Complete Startup Execution Guide

**Status:** Pre-Launch | **Target Launch:** Q1 2025 | **Market:** Belgium → Netherlands

---

## 🎯 Mission
Build the #1 financial management platform for IT freelancers and micro-businesses in Belgium and Netherlands, starting with Belgium's 2026 e-invoicing compliance deadline.

## 📊 Market Opportunity

**Belgium Market (Priority 1)**
- 40,000 IT freelancers (0-1 employees)
- Mandatory e-invoicing: January 1, 2026
- €1,500-5,000 penalties for non-compliance
- Current solutions: Too expensive or too complex
- **Our advantage:** 15 months to capture market before deadline

**Netherlands Market (Priority 2)**
- 147,000 IT freelancers
- No immediate e-invoicing mandate (2030 potential)
- 3.6x larger market but lower urgency
- **Strategy:** Enter 2026 after Belgium PMF

## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### Must-Win Battles
1. **Peppol Certification by Q1 2025** - Non-negotiable for Belgium launch
2. **5 Accountant Partnerships by Month 3** - 30-40% of customer acquisition

4. **€40-80 CAC via Partnerships** - Bootstrap-friendly unit economics
5. **95%+ Monthly Retention by Month 6** - Product-market fit signal

### Key Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Competitors target developers pre-2026 | Medium | High | Launch aggressively Q1 2025, secure first 100 customers |
| Peppol certification delays | Medium | Critical | Start certification NOW, budget €10-15K, 3-month timeline |
| Low accountant interest | Low | High | Offer 25% commission, €100 signup bonus, pilot with 5 firms |
| Solo founder burnout | Medium | Critical | You're prepared to grind - but track output quality, not just hours |
